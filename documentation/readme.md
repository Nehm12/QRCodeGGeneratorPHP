    5. Configuration
The QR Code Generator does not require complex configuration, but here are some details you can customize or adjust as needed.

Customizing the Temporary Folder
By default, the generated QR codes are stored in a temp folder. If you wish to change this, you can modify the file path in the PHP code, where the image is generated:

php
Copy code
$filePath = 'temp/' . $fileName; // Change 'temp' to any other folder of your choice
Modifying Generation Parameters
The PHP QR Code library allows you to customize the size and quality of the generated QR code. You can adjust these settings in the PHP file where the QRcode::png() function is called:

php
Copy code
QRcode::png($data, $filePath, QR_ECLEVEL_L, 4, 4); // Example of modifying error correction level and size
Protecting the Download Folder
If you want to protect access to the downloaded files, you can add security rules in your .htaccess file or manage access through user controls.

    6. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
